title: "The Ps of Job Satisfaction"
---

**People** - Do you like your team? Your manager? The people you interact with and are influenced by daily?

**Projects** - Are you satisfied with your tasks from both macro and micro levels?

**Pay** - Are you compensated fairly?

**Place** - Do you like the location? Is it too remote or does it require too much time in the office?  How is the work culture and environment?

**Personal Growth** - Are you learning enough? Are you growing in the ways you want?

**Position** - Is this particular position good enough for you as a job? As a career?

## Background
Once upon a time I asked a coworker how he likes his job. He told me he goes by "the 3 Ps: the People, Projects, and Pay."

I don't know where he got it, perhaps someone else? But I liked this idea so much, and it's stuck with me ever since, growing into more aspects that I hammer into other words that start with P (`^P[a-z]*`).

Recently a few friends have asked me for career advice, compelling me to finally write this full set of Ps I've had bouncing around in my head.

Notably, I've found the Ps that matter most to me shift as I grow older. I hope this helps you as much as it's helped me.
