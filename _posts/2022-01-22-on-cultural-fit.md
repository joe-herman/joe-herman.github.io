title: "On Cultural Fit"
---

I've read that [hiring](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dangers-of-hiring-for-cultural-fit-11569231000) [biased](https://buffer.com/resources/culture-fit/) for ["cultural fit"](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20211015-what-does-being-a-cultural-fit-actually-mean) is a huge no-no.

At first it makes total sense: diversity is great, we shouldn't just hire people we want to have a beer with, don't promote a monoculture, etc.

So most places rework _cultural fit_ into something like **_values fit_** or **_cultural add_**, where common goals and unique perspectives are valued more than maintaining existing ones.

Ultimately, these "value fits" and "culture adds" still add up to a culture comprised of similar-minded people.

In my slice of Tech, I've found these people tend to be:

* Open-minded
* Respectful of others' beliefs/identity
* Generally not super conservative
* Vaccinated

I recently saw a candidate apply to a healthtech company. Once informed of the company's vaccine mandate, which the candidate disagreed with, they withdrew. They may not have been a _values fit_, but I think that means they weren't a _cultural fit_, either.

Admittedly, I belong to this new culture that's aware of the original "cultural fit" bias. Teams of all white nerdy male wizards or all newly-minted compsci brogrammers seem too... un-diverse. I would have serious reservations working next to someone who refuses to respect a coworker's gender, is too closed-minded to new ideas, or is willingly unvaccinated.

Somehow, in trying to avoid a monoculture, I've arguably found myself in another, broader monoculture!

Despite this culture's awareness of "cultural fit" bias, some people's values are still too different to culturally fit with it.

I think I'm alright with that.
