title: "Auth and everything wrong, part 2"
---

_This is part two of my trilogy laying out what I think I understand about the current state of authorization and everything wrong._

Let's look at the memes of application security.

## GNAP and XYZ

The [Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-02) is a purported foundation of [XYZ](https://oauth.xyz/). XYZ, which sums itself up as "transactional authorization," is probably the closest thing we currently have to [OAuth3](https://oauth.net/3/).

Without getting into too many details, the spirit of [transactional authorization](https://medium.com/oauth-2/transaction-authorization-or-why-we-need-to-re-think-oauth-scopes-2326e2038948) is to authorize individual requests to an API based on dynamic scopes. Contrast this to OAuth2's encouragement to authorize specific parts (usually permissions or roles) within an API, and OAuth1's very coarse-grained, AuthN-like access ("I signed this request with the secret we agreed upon").

The motivations behind GNAP and XYZ are noble, and while their homepage notes the proposal has been made "in the spirit of OAuth2," implementers will be faced with fundamental incompatiblities, in particular **polymorphic JSON** and **additional synchronization between the Resource Server and Authorization Server**.

### What's worse than a JWT?

OAuth2 gives developers a bit too much implementation freedom perhaps, but XYZ goes one step further by [mandating polymorphic JSON](https://oauth.xyz/) in the token format:

> Polymorphic JSON. The protocol elements have different data types that convey additional contextual meaning, allowing us to avoid mutually exclusive protocol elements and design a more succinct and readable protocol. This lets us pass things by reference or by value using the same element field, among other things.

The intent behind this was good: why embed potentially sensitive data within a token when you can reference data with an identifier, assume the Resource Server and Authentication Server both understand the references, and anyone peeking at the token is left with mostly useless information?

Polymorphic JSON says instead of receiving:

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "address": "123 Super Secure Blvd"
  }
}
```

You could _potentially receive_:

```json
{
  "customer": "93f63fdb90d69b73db42b433549e5673c860c3ae"
}
```

Perhaps every attempt I've seen at replacing JSON (BSON, protocol buffers) has attempted to make it easier to parse, whereas polymorphic JSON is the exact opposite--it requires dynamic type checking for every field (counterpoint: safe JSON parsers should be doing that _anyway_) and here, it encourages mixing data types. You may get an identifier, an object, an array... who knows?

I was going to say this complicates things in statically or strongly typed languages, but honestly, I fear reviewing polymorphic JSON implementations regardless of language.

### Synchronization Between the Resource Server and Authorization Server 

[XYZ specifically notes the following feature:](https://oauth.xyz/)

> Ease of transition from OAuth 2. Even though this is not backwards compatible, there should be a clear translation path from OAuth 2 based systems to XYZ.

As someone who worked on an OAuth2 proxy, this seems difficult.

Let's look at [OAuth2.1's protocol flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-00#section-1.2):

```
        +--------+                               +---------------+
        |        |--(1)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
        |        |                               |     Owner     |
        |        |<-(2)-- Authorization Grant ---|               |
        |        |                               +---------------+
        |        |
        |        |                               +---------------+
        |        |--(3)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
        | Client |                               |     Server    |
        |        |<-(4)----- Access Token -------|               |
        |        |                               +---------------+
        |        |
        |        |                               +---------------+
        |        |--(5)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
        |        |                               |     Server    |
        |        |<-(6)--- Protected Resource ---|               |
        +--------+                               +---------------+

```

Note that the client is potentially making a request to three different entities, which are all separated in this diagram for the purposes of request flow at authorization time.

And here is [GNAP's equivalent sequence](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-02#section-1.4):

```
        +------------+             +------------+
        | Requesting | ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ |  Resource  |
        | Party (RQ) |             | Owner (RO) |
        +------------+             +------------+
            +                            +
            +                            +
           (A)                          (B)
            +                            +
            +                            +
        +--------+                       +       +------------+
        |Resource|--------------(1)------+------>|  Resource  |
        | Client |                       +       |   Server   |
        |  (RC)  |       +---------------+       |    (RS)    |
        |        |--(2)->| Authorization |       |            |
        |        |<-(3)--|     Server    |       |            |
        |        |       |      (AS)     |       |            |
        |        |--(4)->|               |       |            |
        |        |<-(5)--|               |       |            |
        |        |--------------(6)------------->|            |
        |        |       |               |<~(7)~~|            |
        |        |<-------------(8)------------->|            |
        |        |--(9)->|               |       |            |
        |        |<-(10)-|               |       |            |
        |        |--------------(11)------------>|            |
        |        |       |               |<~(12)~|            |
        |        |-(13)->|               |       |            |
        |        |       |               |       |            |
        +--------+       +---------------+       +------------+

    Legend
    + + + indicates a possible interaction with a human
    ----- indicates an interaction between protocol roles
    ~ ~ ~ indicates a potential equivalence or out-of-band communication between roles
```

The important distinction here is all the extra connections, particularly [squiggly line for step 7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-02#section-1.4):
```
   *  (7) The RS determines if the token is sufficient for the request
      by examining the token, potentially calling the AS (Section 10.1).
      Note that the RS could also examine the token directly, call an
      internal data store, execute a policy engine request, or any
      number of alternative methods for validating the token and its
      fitness for the request.
```

For a Resource Server tasked with authorizing a client request, OAuth2 implies it could do purely static authorization based on the token itself: "Does this token look signed and does it have the proper scopes inside?"

Meanwhile, a GNAP flow encourages the Resource Server call out to the Authorization Server or other policy engine to assert authorization: "This request just came in, based on everything you know at the moment, should this be authorized?"

For implementers of this protocol change, Step 7's implies an extra hop for a Resource Server to dynamically authorize every request against a policy engine or Authorization Server directly. While XYZ claims a clear translation path is necessary, I believe this will be difficult.

## Zero Trust

Once upon a time, a client was given a secret to sign every request to an API with, which proved who the client was. This was OAuth1, and in this way it sort of conflated authentication with authorization: so long as the secret was the same, the caller was trusted.

OAuth2 first authenticates a user, then has the user obtain application-specific authorizations. Where this authorization grant came from or went doesn't really matter, so long as the application deems its contents satisfactory. Applications could reuse a grant to do things on behalf of a user, and thus authentication separated quite a bit from authorization.

[Every](https://www.cloudflare.com/teams/zero-trust-network-access/) [company](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/zero-trust.html) has [their](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust) [own](https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp/) [set](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/how-to-think-about-zero-trust-architectures-on-aws/) of [tenets](https://www.f5.com/services/resources/use-cases/zero-trust-in-an-application-centric-world) [about](https://www.crowdstrike.com/epp-101/zero-trust-security/) what ["Zero Trust"](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture) [means](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture) to [them](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/security/zero-trust-security-model.jsp).

A good Zero Trust implementation touches application security by blessing a new marriage between authentication and authorization. Every request must come from a trusted, authenticated source before being authorized. As trust changes for any client accessing a resource, it should be handled dynamically.

With its more granular authorization, inferred closer relationship between a resource and authorizer, and dynamic policy enforcer, Zero Trust and GNAP/XYZ have similar tenets. While GNAP/XYZ applies this to an application authorization protocol, Zero Trust creates a larger-scale network (and application) security foundation.

## OPA

Suppose you're looking to implement GNAP or Zero Trust, and you suddenly need an agent to enforce policy. Guaranteed, the first one you'll find while Googling is [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).

While not necessarily a paradigm or protocol like OAuth, GNAP, XYZ, or Zero Trust, Open Policy Agent deserves a solid mention here for being a genius combination of:

* The de-facto standard for a policy agent. Not only is it open source, just look at how many buzzwords are in their opening diagram (screenshot from their homepage):

![Screenshot from https://www.openpolicyagent.org/](/assets/auth-opa.png)

* Ultimate nerd cred for defining policy in Rego. They know their target audience. Rego is perfect for attracting computer science grads to spend hours writing the most efficient policy possible. However, as a product, few users want to write Rego. Rego ends up as the assembly language of policy: it's best when generated from higher-level and more maintainable logic. This will cost some development time.

* Requiring a paid solution to implement well. OPA is _the_ engine for enforcing policy, and sure, it's open. But it's just the engine. But how do you dynamically manage, distribute, and audit policy? Building these tools to be as robust as Styra's offering will certainly tilt any build vs buy analysis for all but considerably largest scale cases.

OPA, while technically _open_, is very much a paid solution. However, it remains perhaps the best implementation of dynamic policy enforcement.

## What's trendy
All these can piece together: GNAP/XYZ's dynamic policy evaluation with every request--using something like OPA--fits within a Zero Trust-like model.

I find it interesting that these solutions have all been developing somewhat independently from the quest of more secure, granular access.

What's frustrating is these solutions are all perhaps _more difficult_ to implement than secure OAuth 2, and that they clearly hail from different aspects of software and maturity.

* GNAP/XYZ feels like the output of software architects who consider developer experience completely secondary, and may be too much like OAuth2 in that a good implementation remains difficult.

* OPA is _the_ policy agent, and quickly turns proprietary in implementation.

* Zero Trust is a collective of ideas yielding proprietary, enterprise-scale product portfolios.

## A Final Wishlist
As many lengthy blog posts established before mine, authorization is hard. For something as deceptively simple as establishing a protocol to return a boolean answer to "can I access this?", we have some wild solutions.

Next time, given all of the above, together with my complaints and experience with OAuth2, I'll take a stab at my wishlist for application security.
